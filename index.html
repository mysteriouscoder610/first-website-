                    In the years after 1919, we see the national movement spreading to
                    new areas, incorporating new social groups, and developing new
                    modes of struggle
                <br><br>
                The Rowlatt Act
                Emboldened with this success, Gandhiji in 1919 decided to launch a
                nationwide satyagraha against the proposed Rowlatt Act (1919). This
                Act had been hurriedly passed through the Imperial Legislative
                Council despite the united opposition of the Indian members

                <h2 class="secHeading1">The Salt March and the Civil Disobedience Movement</h2>
                    <p class="text1">
                        Mahatma Gandhi found in salt a powerful symbol that could unite
                        the nation. On 31 January 1930, he sent a letter to Viceroy Irwin
                        stating eleven demands. Some of these were of general interest;
                        others were specific demands of different classes, from industrialists
                        to peasants
                        <br><br>
                    Mahatma Gandhi’s letter was, in a way, an ultimatum. If the
                    demands were not fulfilled by 11 March, the letter stated, the
                    Congress would launch a civil disobedience campaign. Irwin was
                    unwilling to negotiate. So Mahatma Gandhi started his famous
                    salt march accompanied by 78 of his trusted volunteers.

                        Not all social groups were moved by the abstract concept of swaraj.
                        One such group was the nation’s ‘untouchables’, who from around
                        the 1930s had begun to call themselves dalit or oppressed. For
                        long the Congress had ignored the dalits, for fear of offending the
                        sanatanis, the conservative high-caste Hindus.
                        <br><br>
                        Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who organised the dalits into the Depressed
                        Classes Association in 1930, clashed with Mahatma Gandhi at
                        the second Round Table Conference by demanding separate
                        electorates for dalits.

                <h2 class="secHeading1">Sense of collective belonging</h2>
                    <p class="text1">
                        This sense of collective belonging came partly through the experience
                    of united struggles. But there were also a variety of cultural processes
                    through which nationalism captured people’s imagination. History
                    and fiction, folklore and songs, popular prints and symbols, all played
                    a part in the making of nationalism
                        <br><br>
                        Ideas of nationalism also developed through a movement to revive
                    Indian folklore. In late-nineteenth-century India, nationalists began
                    recording folk tales sung by bards and they toured villages to gather
                    folk songs and legends. These tales, they believed, gave a true picture
                    of traditional culture that had been corrupted and damaged by
                    outside forces.
